# The Zote Programming Language

Welcome to this short book about the Zote programming language. This language was written in part to become a pleasant scripting language, mainly targeting programming puzzles such as [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), and int part as an experiment to play around with different language features. It is a dynamically typed language with a large focus on ergonomic functional pipes.

## Who is Zote For?

Zote is useful when you want to write short scripts, and prefer the Zote way of writing over similar languages like Python. We recommend playing around with its syntax, and hope some of its ideas (not necessarily novel) will become more common in other languages.

However, Zote has some flaws, such as lacking documentation and bugs, and we therefore recommend other more mature languages if you are just looking for a productive language. Furthermore, Zote by default compiles and runs a custom bytecode format, which is not optimized and often about 3 times slower than similar Python code.

## How to Use This Book

This book servers as documentation for Zote, and hopes to give a good overview over everything from the syntax to the standard library. It is relatively dry, and we recommend first getting an overview of the chapters, and then coming back and use it as a reference manual when you are unsure of how something works.

In general, we will try to cover most things in this book, but we will surely not manage to cover everything (or be correct about everything). Therefore, the Zote source code will continue to be the ground truth of how the language works.
