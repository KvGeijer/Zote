# Grammar

The building blocks of Zote programs are statements and expressions, as most similar languages. However, Zote goes beyond the normal conventions by treating as much as possible as expressions, allowing you to combine them in a (arguably) nice way, such as below.

```
for row in matrix for item in row if item != 1 {
  ...
}
```
