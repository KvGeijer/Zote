# Types

Zote only has a handful of types, and can be loosely classified into _primitive_ types, _collection_ types, and _closures_. The primitive types are essentially numbers and are each representable by up to 64 bits. On the other hand, _collections_ contains a number of values, such as lists or dictionaries. Finally, closures can be seen as functions, together with a set of references to values bound to the function.
