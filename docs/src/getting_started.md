# Getting Started

This chapter describes how to install and write your first _Hello, World_ Zote script.

TODO: There exists two zote versions, the normal `zote` and the earlier `ast-zote`. The ast-zote will not be described much in this book, but it directly interprets the syntax tree instaed of compiling to bytecode. It is usually slower, but has more built-in functions, which can be faster as more code is executed directly in Rust. Furthermore, the AST version has a nicer REPL, keeping its state between invocations.
