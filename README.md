# The Zote programming language

All information about the language is found at its github page [https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote). But in short it is a small interpreted dynamic scripting language, made mostly for fun.

## Benchmark monitoring

To keep track of any potential changes in performance of the language this page monitors the benchmarks you can see [this page](https://benchmark-action.github.io/github-action-benchmark/dev/bench/) monitors the [performance benchmarks](./benches). The code for the benchmarks can be found [here](./benches).
