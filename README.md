# The Zote programming language

All information about the language is found at its github page [https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote). But in short it is a small interpreted dynamic scripting language, made mostly for fun.

## Benchmark monitoring

A continuous monitoring of the benchmarks can be seen [here](https://kvgeijer.github.io/zote/dev/bench/). The code for the benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote/tree/main/benches).
